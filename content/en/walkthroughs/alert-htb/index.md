# Summary
Alert is an easy-difficulty `Linux` machine that showcases `Stored Client-Side Cross-Side Scripting (XSS)`, which leads to Server-Side exploitation. This vulnerability is triggered by uploading malicious `XSS payload` through the webpage, which is later executed when shared through the contact form. After manual directory enumeration of `apache2` configuration, `.htpasswd` document containing password hash of user `albert` is found and cracked using `hashcat`. Privilege escalation is then possible by exploiting a misconfigured directory that allows modifications, but is accessible only on `localhost`. However, the private website that runs on this directory is executed with `root` privileges. The misconfiguration is then exploited by uploading a `PHP shell` to the directory which is then accessed via browser to gain elevated privileges.

## Skills Needed:
- Cross-Side Scripting
- Basic `Linux` and Privilege Management Knowledge
- `PHP reverse shell`
- Familiarity with default `apache2` configurations

# Enumeration
## Port Scan
Scanning the ports of the target using `nmap` reveals 2 open ports.
````bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 10.10.11.44
````
![NMAP Scan result](nmap-result.png)
We can see from the results that `port 80` uses `Apache httpd 2.4.41` and redirects to https://alert.htb/. We also have `ssh` on `port 22`.
## `Alert.htb` Enumeration
![Alert.htb Markdown Viewer Page](alert-htb-MainPage.png)
After adding the redirect domain to `/etc/hosts`, we can observe that there is a markdown file upload field.

Further navigating to the `About Us` page also reveals the following message, indicating that the contact form on the website may have an automated system that interacts with the form thus indicating a possible `XSS` or `XSS via interaction`.
![Alert.htb About Page](alert-htb-AboutPage.png)
Upon uploading the test script to the `Markdown Viewer`, and viewing it through the browser we can see that the system allows us to inject `javascript` code to the website, thus confirming `XSS`.

![Alert.htb XSS Proof of Concept Confirmation](alert-htb-XSS-PoC-Confirmation.png)
A manual and automated directory enumeration also revealed additional `/messages/`, `/uploads/`, `messages.php`, `visualization.php` that exists in this website.
````bash
gobuster dir â€“url http://alert.htb -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
````

## Subdomain Enumeration
Further subdomain enumeration via `wfuzz` show that the server uses a subdomain called `statistics`. (Due note, we have to filter the subdomains by word since it is the only parameter that is static therefore `--hw 28`)
````bash
wfuzz -u http://alert.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.alert.htb" --hw 28
````

# Foothold
We can now exploit the previously mentioned `XSS` vulnerability by uploading a `javascript` code on the markdown file upload to retrieve contents of files. We first get the contents of `messages.php` and see its contents, after analyzing it we can see that this path (`?file=`) is vulnerable to `Local File Inclusion (LFI)`.
I have created a simple `PHP handler` for the purposes of this vulnerability.
![PHP Handler](php-handler.png)
We then can access `/etc/passwd` through;
![LFI Proof of Concept](LFI-PoC.png)
![LFI Proof of Concept Confirmation](LFI-PoC-Confirmation.png)
Using the same exploit, I then proceeded to retrieve the config files of apache2 (`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`) where we can see the exact location of `.htpasswd` that restricts the subdomain `statistics.alert.htb`.
![Retrieved Apache 2 Config](Retrieved-Apache2-Config.png)
After identifying the existence of `.htpasswd`, we then retrieve it, again, using the same exploit where we receive the user albert and the password hash (clipped in accordance with HTB ToS).
````bash
albert:<SNIP>
````
We then proceed to retrieve the password through this hash using `hashcat`.
````bash
hashcat hash.txt --show
````
We then, as it is standard practice to enumerate, try this credentials on SSH port and successfully login as user `albert`. We can then cat `user.txt`!!!

# Privilege Escalation
Now that we have user privileges, we can look up active processes that run on root. There we see an interesting `PHP` process that uses (is bound to) `127.0.0.1:8080` which runs at `/opt/website-monitor`.
````bash
ps aux | grep "root"
````
![PS AUX](ps-aux-root.png)
We can then locate to `/opt/website-monitor/` where we see an interesting misconfiguration of permissions of folder `config`. We appear to have write privileges, as we are also in the group `management`.
![Misconfigured Directory](misconfigured-directory.png)
Since the `PHP` process that runs this script is launched through the user `root`, we can easily write a simple `PHP RCE` and get the contents of `root.txt`.
![Php Shell Root](php-shell-root.png)
We should also not forget that we have to forward the port 8080 to our host to be able to navigate to the website.
````bash
ssh -L 8000:alert.htb:8080 albert@albert.htb
````
![Privileged Website](albert-privileged-website.png)
We can then locate to our script and get the contents of `root.txt`.
